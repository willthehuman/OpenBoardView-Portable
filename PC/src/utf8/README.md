A simple one header solution to supporting utf8 strings in C and C++.

Functions are provided to match the string.h header but with a utf8* prefix instead of the str* prefix from string.h.

string.h | utf8.h | complete
---------|--------|---------
strcat | utf8cat | &#10004;
strchr | utf8chr | &#10004;
strcmp | utf8cmp | &#10004;
strcoll | utf8coll |
strcpy | utf8cpy | &#10004;
strcspn | utf8cspn | &#10004;
strdup | utf8dup | &#10004;
strfry | utf8fry |
strlen | utf8len | &#10004;
strncat | utf8ncat | &#10004;
strncmp | utf8ncmp | &#10004;
strncpy | utf8ncpy | &#10004;
strpbrk | utf8pbrk | &#10004;
strrchr | utf8rchr | &#10004;
strsep | utf8sep |
 | utf8size | &#10004;
strspn | utf8spn | &#10004;
strstr | utf8str | &#10004;
strtok | utf8tok |
 | utf8valid | &#10004;
strxfrm | utf8xfrm |

strings.h | utf8.h | complete
---------|--------|---------
strcasecmp | utf8casecmp | ~~&#10004;~~
strncasecmp | utf8ncasecmp | ~~&#10004;~~
strcasestr | utf8casestr | ~~&#10004;~~

## Usage ##

Just include utf8.h in your code!

The current supported compilers are gcc, clang and msvc.

The current tested compiler versions are gcc 4.8.2, clang 3.5 and MSVC 18.0.21005.1.

## Design ##

The utf8.h API matches the string.h API as much as possible by design. There are a few major differences though.

I use void* instead of char* when passing around utf8 strings. My reasoning is that I really don't want people accidentally thinking they can use integer arthimetic on the pointer and always get a valid character like you would with an ASCII string. Having it as a void* forces a user to explicitly cast the utf8 string to char* such that the onus is on them not to break the code anymore!

Anywhere in the string.h documentation where it refers to 'bytes' I have changed that to utf8 codepoints. For instance, utf8len will return the number of utf8 codepoints in a utf8 string - which does not necessarily equate to the number of bytes.

## Todo ##

- Implement utf8coll (akin to strcoll).
- Implement utf8fry (akin to strfry).
- Add NULL pointer support. Should I NULL check the arguments to the API?
- Add Doxygen (or similar) to mimic the Unix man pages for string.h.
- Investigate adding dst buffer sizes for utf8cpy and utf8cat to catch overwrites (as suggested by [@FlohOfWoe](https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe) in https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/618669237771608064)
- Investigate adding a utf8canon which would turn 'bad' utf8 sequences (like ASCII values encoded in 4-byte utf8 codepoints) into their 'good' equivalents (as suggested by [@KmBenzie](https://twitter.com/KmBenzie))
- Investigate changing to [Creative Commons Zero License](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt) (as suggested by [@mcclure111](https://twitter.com/mcclure111))
- ~~Add utf8casecmp and utf8ncasecmp to compare two strings case-insensitively (as insensitively suggested by [@daniel_collin](https://twitter.com/daniel_collin))~~
- Extend utf8casecmp range to consume non-ASCII case differences too (I don't even rightly know if there are any!)
